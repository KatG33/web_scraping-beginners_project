##Web Scraper Project
#Overview
This project is my first attempt at creating a Python-based web scraper to collect data from websites for analysis.

#Features
Data Extraction: Gathers specific information from web pages.
Data Storage: Saves the collected data in formats like CSV or JSON for easy analysis.
#Learning Resource
I followed Angelica Dietzel's tutorial, "How to Build a Web Scraper With Python [Step-by-Step Guide]," to develop this project.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
requests
beautifulsoup4
pandas (for data manipulation)

#Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraper-project.git
cd web-scraper-project

#Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

#Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

#Set the Target URL:
Update the config.py file with the URL of the website you want to scrape.

#Run the Scraper:
python scraper.py
View the Output:

The data will be saved in the output directory in your chosen format.

#Legal and Ethical Considerations
Ensure your web scraping activities comply with the target website's terms of service. Check the site's robots.txt file for any restrictions. Unauthorized data extraction can have legal consequences.
